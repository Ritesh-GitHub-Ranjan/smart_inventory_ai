# Smart Inventory AI - Agent Interaction Design

## Core Data Flow
1. **Inventory Data Sources** feed into the system
2. **Inventory Agent** processes raw data and detects critical states
3. Specialized agents handle specific aspects:
   - Visualization (Inventory Monitor)
   - Replenishment (Reorder Agent)
   - Pricing (Pricing Agent)
   - Forecasting (Forecasting Agent)

## Key Integration Points
- All agents log activities through centralized logging
- Shared database maintains state consistency
- Common data formats enable interoperability

## Error Handling
- Audit Agent monitors all transactions
- Automatic alerts for data inconsistencies
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations

## Performance Metrics
- Inventory turnover rate
- Stockout frequency
- Order fulfillment time
- Pricing effectiveness
